# SymbiOnt

A toolkit building implementing workflows to merge / augment existing ontologies. SymbiOnt builds on existing tools, such as ontology matchers, SSSOM python toolkit and Boomer.

## Basic workflow

The entire pipeline is implemented as commands in a docker image. As there are different tech stacks involved (running on different versions of python), different tools stitched together (matching tools such as RDF matcher, Agreement Maker Light; merging tools such as ROBOT, boomer) etc, the container is _huge_ (2GB compressed). The state of the workflows are totally experimental (pre-Alpha), so hiccups should be expected. At the moment, I use `symbiont` like this:

1. Add the [symbiont execution script](bin/symbiont) (basically a docker wrapper) to my path
2. Update `symbiont` (make sure you clean up old versions from time to time as well!): `docker pull monarchinitiative/symbiont
`
3. Run the tests: `make test` (relies on you having done step 1.)
